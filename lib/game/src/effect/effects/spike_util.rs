//! Shared math for `PP_3DQUADHORN` "spike" effects (ice/stone blades).
//!
//! The original game's QuadHorn spikes all behave the same way: a blade
//! whose apex direction is set by a pitch (`m_latitude`) + yaw
//! (`m_longitude`), which rises along that direction for the first
//! `PTQH_SPEEDLIMIT` frames and then freezes, holding full alpha until a
//! short linear fade-out tail at the end of its life. FrostDiver, Grimtooth,
//! EarthSpike, IceWall and GrimToothAtk only differ in how the spikes are
//! placed and sized, so the per-spike motion lives here.
